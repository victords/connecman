instructions_0		GAME\nConnecMan is an easy-to-understand puzzle game. The basis of the game is to connect similar pieces (pieces of the same color and with the same symbol) by 'energy lines'. 'Energy lines' are composed by at maximum three segments (see below).
instructions_1		One of ConnecMan's features is the variety of piece types you'll find along the game. Besides common pieces (red, blue and green), there are stone blocks, which won't let any 'energy line' pass through, and ice blocks, which do the same, but you can melt them down by connecting pieces around them, as showed below:
instructions_2		Other pieces you can connect: strong pieces, that need to be connected twice to be eliminated, metal pieces, which are worth more points, but their value decreases with time, and mobile pieces, which you can move in the directions indicated by small yellow arrows. See the image below:
instructions_3		ConnecMan is composed by 25 challenging levels, distributed by five amazing sceneries. The common objective is to eliminate all connective pieces. However, there are special levels (the last of each scenario) which to accomplish you'll need to form Nisled words - read about Nisled in 'About', inside 'More...' -, using the white pieces. This is done by connecting them in the correct order.
instructions_4		Making ConnecMan even more interesting, in some levels you may have items to use, helping you at achieving the goal. There are three kinds of items, each one with a function. Explore the 25 levels to find out their uses!
instructions_5		In ConnecMan you don't need to worry about forgetting to save the game: when you click 'Exit', the game automatically asks you whether to save your progress.\n\nIn the status screen, you can see how much progress you have made so far. The nisled letters or numbers you have learned are shown in the bottom of this screen, in the following way:
instructions_6		CONTROLS\nIn 'Options' you can set the game controls to mouse or keyboard. Using the mouse, all actions are made by a single click of the left button. When set to keyboard, it works as follows:\n- Directional keys (arrows): navigate in menus and move the cursor in the game acreen.\n- Space bar: execute an action (select an option in a menu, select a piece or an item in the main game).\n- Tab: switch between the main game screen and the panel, located below it. Also used to switch between the text field and the buttons in the save game menu.
instructions_7		SHORTCUT KEYS\nAlso in 'Options', you can turn these ON or OFF. When ON, their functions are:\n- C: switch the game controls between mouse and keyboard.\n- P: pause the game and open the menu.\n- R: restart current level.\n- W: select, when available, a 'Wave Transmitter'.\n- H: select, when available, an 'Hourglass'.\n- D: select, when available, a 'Dynamite'.\n\nYou can also use Alt+Enter to switch between window and full screen at any time.

about_0				ConnecMan is an explorer who decided to take a journey through the mysterious Nislands. There, he found traces of an ancient civilization, which appeared to have a very rich culture.\nSo, his aim is to unravel the mysteries of this civilization and try to decipher their beautiful language, which he called Nisled.
about_1				Studying the crystal pieces he found in those islands, ConnecMan discovered that Nisled is an interesting language, for it's composed by an 'alphabet' and some more complex symbols, generally representing concrete or abstract things.
about_2				Carved in each of the crystal pieces is a Nisled letter or algarism, and combining similar pieces, a lot of energy is spread, revealing part of the knowledge left by that civilization. So, ConnecMan decided to travel from island to island, combining crystal pieces to learn more. And here's your part in this story: help ConnecMan to decipher the Nisled enigmas and learn this eccentric language too!

message_title_25	The final challenge!
message_1			Select a piece and then select another with same color and symbol. The connection between them, an 'energy line', can be composed of at maximum three segments. Stone blocks will block energy lines.
message_2			Ice blocks work the same as stone blocks, but they can be eliminated by connecting pieces around them.
message_3			Some pieces need to be connected to two others, in order to be eliminated.
message_4			When an energy line can't be formed between two pieces, a Wave Transmitter (shortcut key W) may come in handy: it transmits the energy needed to create the connection between two pieces, regardless of their positions.
message_5			Not enough time? Then, just stop it for some seconds, using an Hourglass (shortcut key H).
message_6			When you see White Pieces in the board, your objective is different: you just have to eliminate them, not worrying about other pieces. However, in order to do that, you must connect all of them at once, and in the correct order. And here comes another item: Dynamites (shortcut key D) can destroy anything in the board, except common stone blocks, and, as you don't want to make certain levels impossible, White Pieces.
message_7			Oooooh... What shining crystal pieces! These metal-like pieces are more valuable, but with time they will become almost like common pieces. The golden ones are the most valuable, followed by silver and then by bronze.
message_10			Some pieces can be moved in certain directions, signed by small arrows on their border. To move a piece, just click it and then in an empty space around it, since it's in a direction that this piece can move.
message_25			Having collected the crystals of the four elements, ConnecMan departs for the last island, where he finds a strange temple. He then realizes he is before the last puzzle left by the Nisled civilization. Do not be intimidated by the size of this puzzle and put your brain to work!
